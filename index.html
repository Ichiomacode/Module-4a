        <p><b> Faustina Ichioma Onoriode</b></p>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp I fell in love with technology because
          <b> it changes the world</b> and makes people to meet their needs or
          to solve practical problems. There is no joy than knowing that i can
          be in my own <i>  workspace</i> and still be <b> <i> valuable smart,creative, meet new
          people and give back to te society.</i></b> And above all with technology i
          can get better oppotunities. Going into technology is one i journey i will never regret.

        <h2>What i've learn't so far and the importance of CSS</h2>
        <p>
            My experience with <i> stutern</i> has been a great one so far and <b> i've learn't the following</b>
          <ul>
            &nbsp &nbsp <li>Types and <i> methods of CSS</i> i.e :(inline css,internal css and external css)</li>
            &nbsp &nbsp <li>CSS selectors</li>
            &nbsp &nbsp  <li>CSS synthax</li>
            &nbsp &nbsp <li>Box model(margin,border,and padding )</li>
            &nbsp &nbsp <li>CSS properties</li>
            &nbsp &nbsp <li>CSS list type</li>
            &nbsp &nbsp<li>how to use nbsp</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
          <P> <b>Importance of CSS</b>:CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to 
            the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format</P>

        <h2>Differences between padding,margin and border</h2>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Padding:</b> An element's padding area is the <b> <i> space between its
              content </i></b> and its border. Note: Padding creates extra space within an element</li>
            <li><b>Margin:</b> creates extra space around an element.
              The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements,
              outside of any <i> defined borders.</i> With CSS, you have full control over
              the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side
              of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).</li>
            <li> <b> CSS border:</b>It properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.
            </li>
          </ol>
            </p>
            <p> <b>In summary</b>: <i>padding</i> creates space within an element, <b><i>margin</i></b> craetes space around an element while 
              the <b><i> border</i></b> sets the border around an HTML element, meaning all four borders (top, right, bottom and left).
